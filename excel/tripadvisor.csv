This level or service, being greeted at the door and escorted all the way to the room by the same person is first class.  Gaetan also checked us out and greeted us by name.  We enjoyed dinner the first night in Dani, the rooftop restaurant.  It was Valentine's day and the restaurant was well decorated and playing fun music.  The food and drinks were delicious and the service was excellent.  The manager helped us to choose a great bottle of wine.  We had cocktails another night in Isa Cocktail Bar, which was debuting a new menu.  The server talked us through the interesting menu and recommended inventive drinks that we thoroughly enjoyed.   Each night with turndown service there was an interesting card placed on the bed with information about the hotel or local points of interest (food markets, museums, etc).  This was such a nice touch.  The concierge recommended a seafood restaurant that was exactly what we wanted.  Finally, the location is great and we were able to walk everywhere....The Prado, The Royal Palace, restaurants, Retiro Park.

Everything you needed, nothing you didnt and it all functioned extremely well!  We enjoyed drinks in the lobby, at Dani and meals there as well. We also spent time in the fitness center and in the spa. All experiences were excellent!  One highlight --- we had been out shopping and were going to just pass by the hotel to drop off a bag. The bellman who welcomed us recognized us and offered to take the bags off our hands and put them in our room so we did not have to go into the hotel and could continue exploring the city.

We had the opportunity to stay at your hotel during the weekend of Christmas, and every member of your team welcomed us as if as a guest to your amazing home.  Everyone made our visit exceptional; from the driver from the airport to the hotel, all the staff that greeted us as we pulled up to the hotel, the front desk staff that not only made our welcome early in the morning so bright but also started a �treasure hunt� for our son with the Four Season�s passport, the concierge team that not only made all reservations so seamless but also helped our son collect all the stamps for his passport, and of course, Santa, who showed our son all around the hotel!  We arrived early in the morning, and not only was our suite ready for us, but the hotel had set up an amazing breakfast for us in our room, complete with coffee and champagne!  Throughout the whole stay, every member of the hotel went out of their way to welcome us and make our son feel like a superstar.  We had the opportunity to celebrate Christmas Eve at the hotel gala.  The ambience and food was incredible; however, even more memorable was the focus on the guests, especially our son, who ended up on stage singing with the evening entertainers!  The next morning, he met Santa, who gave him a tour of the hotel as well as being gracious enough to take pictures with him in front of the Christmas Tree.  We also had the opportunity to dine at Isa restaurant.  Once again, the food and cocktails were amazing, but the highlight was how the staff, our server and the manager, made our son feel so special.  He was taken to the kitchen with a chef�s hat, got to learn how to make sushi, and even sign the �celebrity book�!  We have had the privilege and honor of visiting many Four Seasons hotels, as well as many other extraordinary hotels.  The Four Seasons Madrid with their amazing staff and property has set a new bar in hospitality.  Thank you so much for welcoming us to your home and celebrating Christmas with us.

It's located in a run-down area close to nowhere you want to go.  The hotel's dining options are limited: snacks at the Bar, limited dishes in the small lobby area or Dani on the top floor which they hail as their signature Spanish dining venue. The trouble with Dani is the decor is soulless and the staff have such an attitude as to be offensive - other reviewers here have complained about the hostess/receptionist for some time. After a drink on the terrace on the first night we decided we'd drink and dine elsewhere for the rest of the stay, so I can't comment on the food.  The website images of the rooms are misleading: the Deluxe Alcala room at EUR950 per night did not have floor to ceiling windows onto the street",Apr 2022,n,n,n,,n,n,,,
